# UFOs

### Project
<br />
This dynamic webpage was created using Javascript, CSS, and HTML to filter data about UFO sightings.
<br />
The following files were built using Visual Studio Code:<br />
Index.html<br />
app.js<br />
style.css<br />
<br />
The HTML file uses bootstrap to show filters with Date/Time, City, State, Country and Shape.<br />
The Javascript file includes functions that builds a table, filters values, and create a view based on user interaction.<br />
The CSS file formats the website.<br />
<br />
### Recommendations for Further Development
<br />
Create a dropdown to give end users the option to filter based on the available data i.e. Allow the user to be able to choose a date, or country<br />
Give an option to map results visually using Google Maps API (if Latitude and Longitude is available)<br />
Store data in a NoSQL database such as MongoDB<br />
<br />
### Website
<br />
The website (index.html) looks like the following:<br />
